# Attention-ATN

## Overview
**Attention-ATN** is an advanced deep learning framework designed to improve the assessment of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers, specifically Amyloid, Tau, and Neurodegeneration (ATN), by integrating multi-modal MRI data. The model uniquely combines T1 MRI and T2 star-weighted MRI using self-modal and cross-modal attention mechanisms. This integration aims to enhance the predictive power of the model, particularly in assessing amyloid levels.

## Key Features
- **Multi-Modal Integration:** Utilizes both T1 MRI and T2 star-weighted MRI to improve biomarker prediction.
- **Attention Mechanisms:** Implements self-modal and cross-modal attention mechanisms for more accurate feature extraction and integration.
- **SHAP Analysis:** Incorporates SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for interpreting the importance of imaging and clinical features in the model's predictions.
- **3D Visualization:** Development and upcoming release of **3DShapBrainPlot**, a tool for visualizing SHAP values across 3D brain regions, extending SHAP's application in multi-modal imaging models.
