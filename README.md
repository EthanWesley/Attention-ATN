## Attention-ATN: A Multi-Modal Deep Learning Framework for Assessing Amyloid, Tau, and Neurodegeneration Biomarkers of Alzheimerâ€™s Disease

## Overview
**Attention-ATN** is an advanced deep learning framework designed to improve the assessment of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers, specifically Amyloid, Tau, and Neurodegeneration (ATN), by integrating multi-modal MRI data. The model uniquely combines T1 MRI and T2 star-weighted MRI using self-modal and cross-modal attention mechanisms. This integration aims to enhance the predictive power of the model, particularly in assessing amyloid levels.

## Key Features
- **Multi-Modal Integration:** Utilizes both T1 MRI and T2 star-weighted MRI to improve biomarker prediction.
- **Attention Mechanisms:** Implements self-modal and cross-modal attention mechanisms for more accurate feature extraction and integration.
- **SHAP Analysis:** Incorporates SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for interpreting the importance of imaging and clinical features in the model's predictions.
- **3D Visualization:** Development and upcoming release of **3DShapBrainPlot**, a tool for visualizing SHAP values across 3D brain regions, extending SHAP's application in multi-modal imaging models.

## Research Context
This project represents the first systematic study on the significance of T2 star-weighted MRI in ATN-focused deep learning models. It also explores the introduction of cross-modal attention mechanisms and the use of blood biomarkers as labels in ATN classification.

## Open Source Commitment
We are committed to open science and will be releasing the full codebase for **Attention-ATN** following the publication of our research. The release will include the model architecture, training scripts, and the **3DShapBrainPlot** tool. Stay tuned for updates!
